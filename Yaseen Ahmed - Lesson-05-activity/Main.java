    **** Bonus Challenge ****:
    Create a variable that stores the total number of eggs 
    and assign it 100. We want to fill as many baskets with 
    eggs as we can. Each basket can hold only 12 eggs.

    1) Write the java code that will calcute how many baskets
    of 12 eggs can we fill fully.

    HINT: What do we get when we divide an integer by 
    an integer in Java

    2) Write the java code that will calculate how many eggs
    are left over after we filled as many baskets of 12 eggs.
